# Phoenix-Force-Contract
The Phoenix Force token is a cosmic phenomenon that possesses restorative tokenomic properties that can instantly raise coins when they fall and legend has it can even grant moonshot immortality.



The problem with 99% of the Defi tokens out there is that sometimes they catch fire and sometimes they have built in buy-backs features, but given time most cannot withstand the agony of age and user shiny object boredom, which eventually leads to them withering away like the coldness of life itself.

The sorcerers and engineers at Phoenix Force Token have a combined 100 years of crypto and dark magic experience together. They’ve constructed the greatest smart contract coin ever to be forged by woman (which we expect to be cloned by a thousand shittier coins in the next few weeks).

Long term, we’re creating a community of people who want to see things live forever including an NFT platform.
